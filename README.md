### Features
- Marketplace for investing in solar projects
- Real-time project tracking and status updates
- Personalized dashboards for user investments
- Community features: forums, educational resources, project voting

---

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js (or Angular for larger teams)
- **Backend**: Spring Boot
- **Database**: MySQL (main database), MongoDB (for NoSQL storage)
- **Cloud**: AWS (for hosting, data storage, and scaling)
- **Mobile App Prototype**: Flutter (for Android and iOS apps)

## Setup Instructions

### Pre-requisites
1. **Java**: Ensure Java 11+ is installed.
2. **Node.js**: Required for frontend; version 14+ is recommended.
3. **MySQL and MongoDB**: Install and set up MySQL and MongoDB on your local environment.
4. **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed if you plan to use Docker instead of running locally.

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in both backend and frontend directories, or set environment variables directly. Hereâ€™s an example:

#### For Backend
```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your_database
AWS_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_access_key
AWS_SECRET_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
```

#### For Frontend
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

### Database Setup
1. **MySQL**: 
   - Start the MySQL server.
   - Create the necessary database and user tables.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE solar_marketplace;
     USE solar_marketplace;
     ```
2. **MongoDB**:
   - Ensure MongoDB is running.
   - Create a database for storing NoSQL data, if necessary.

## Running the Application

### Running Locally

#### Step 1: Backend (Spring Boot)
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```
3. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
4. The server should now be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

#### Step 2: Frontend (React.js)
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the frontend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. The frontend should be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Running with Docker
1. **Build Docker images**:
   - Backend:
     ```bash
     docker build -t renewable-marketplace-backend ./backend
     ```
   - Frontend:
     ```bash
     docker build -t renewable-marketplace-frontend ./frontend
     ```
2. **Run Docker containers**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
3. The application should now be running, with the backend at `http://localhost:8080` and the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`.
